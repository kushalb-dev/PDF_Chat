# PDF Chat

### This project is a simple implementation of a PDF Chatter that uses:

1. PyPDF: To read and parse PDF Files
2. AstraDB: To store the text chunks and convert them into vector embeddings using OpenAI Embeddings
3. Streamlit: To represent the UI
4. Langchain: To configure the llms and parse the text from the pdf


### Prerequisites

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Be sure to initialize your own AstraDB, OPENAI_API_KEY and generate all the required environment variables.
